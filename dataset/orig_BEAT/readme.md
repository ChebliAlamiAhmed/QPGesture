In response to this [issue](https://github.com/YoungSeng/QPGesture/issues/7)

### 1. Get the original BEAT dataset

First download `1_wayne_0_1_8.TextGrid`, `1_wayne_0_1_8.wav`, and `1_wayne_0_1_8.bvh` from [BEAT](https://pantomatrix.github.io/BEAT/). Let's use these three files of speaker `1` as an example.
And put them in `./dataset/orig_BEAT/speakers/1/`.
